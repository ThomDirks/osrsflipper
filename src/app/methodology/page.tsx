      <H>Data source</H>
      <ul>
        <li><b>OSRS Wiki Real-time Prices API v2</b> (<code>prices.runescape.wiki/api/v2/osrs</code>): <code>/mapping</code> (metadata, limits), <code>/latest</code> (last instant-buy/-sell observation), <code>/5m</code>, <code>/1h</code> and <code>/24h</code> (averages & volume per block; the last 30 completed days for the 30-day check), <code>/timeseries</code> (history: 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d, 6m, 1y).</li>
        <li>According to the wiki, data has come from Jagex (all clients) since 30 Sep 2026; before that only from RuneLite users. Older history is therefore based on a smaller sample.</li>
        <li>There is <b>no public order book</b>. “Instant-buy” is the last price someone bought at instantly; “instant-sell” the last price of an instant sale. That doesn’t mean you can trade at those prices right now.</li>
        <li>Caching: server cache (latest/5m 60 s, 1h 5 min, mapping 6 h, completed hourly blocks 26 h, completed days 32 days). If the API fails, the last successful data is shown with its age – never made-up values.</li>
      </ul>

      <H>GE tax</H>
      <p>
        {TAX_RULES.rate * 100}% of the sell price <b>per item</b>, rounded down to whole coins (so prices under 50 gp are tax-free), at most {TAX_RULES.capPerItem.toLocaleString("de-CH")} gp per item. {Object.keys(TAX_RULES.exemptItems).length} items are exempt (e.g. Old school bond, energy potions, basic tools, teleport tablets). As of {TAX_RULES.verifiedAt}.
      </p>

      <H>Scanner estimates</H>
      <ul>
        <li>Est. buy price = last instant-sell + offset; est. sell price = last instant-buy − offset (offset adjustable, default 1 gp).</li>
        <li>Net margin = sell − tax(sell) − buy. ROI = net margin ÷ buy.</li>
        <li>Quantity = min(⌊capital ÷ buy⌋, GE limit). Only known limits are used; if the limit is missing, “Not available” is shown.</li>
        <li>Buy limit tracking: the GE limit applies for 4 hours from your first buy of an item. Buys you logged in that window plus open buy offers are subtracted from the limit, so the quantity never exceeds what you can still buy. Buys you didn’t log are unknown to the app.</li>
        <li>Profit @ capital = net margin × quantity. Potential per limit = net margin × limit (independent of capital).</li>

      <p>Items excluded from the Top 10 by these rules aren’t hidden: the <b>Volatile</b> tab lists them (same margin and volume criteria, up to 20, filterable by reason) with the reason and a rough <b>downside</b>: what you’d lose if a spike falls back to the 7-day level, a crash continues one more day, or an erratic item makes one typical daily swing down – starting from the sell price at the conservative margin, after tax. The default sort is profit ÷ downside. Flagged items always count as high risk. Check the chart and decide yourself. Each flag appears as a reason on the item (scanner tooltip, Top 10 card, item page). If the 30-day history can’t be loaded, only the 24h checks apply and a notice is shown.</p>

      <H>Market indicators (item page)</H>
      <ul>
        <li>Price per time step = volume-weighted mean of average instant-buy and average instant-sell.</li>
        <li>Price change = (last − first point with trades) ÷ first. Volatility = standard deviation of log returns (per time step, not annualised).</li>
        <li>Median, mean, min/max, range = (max − min) ÷ mean, deviation = (last − mean) ÷ mean.</li>
        <li>With fewer than 10 points with trades, stats are considered unreliable. Gaps are never interpolated.</li>
      </ul>

      <H>Technical indicators (item page)</H>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculated on the chart’s time range from the mid price per step. Periods count <b>steps</b> (5 min on 6 h/24 h, 1 h on 7 d, 6 h on 30 d, 1 day on 6 m/1 y), not days. Steps without trades are skipped.</li>
        <li><b>SMA n</b> = mean of the last n prices. <b>EMA n</b> = exponential average with weight 2 ÷ (n + 1), started from the SMA.</li>
        <li><b>RSI 14</b> with Wilder smoothing: 100 − 100 ÷ (1 + avg gain ÷ avg loss). Above 70 reads as overbought, below 30 as oversold.</li>
        <li><b>MACD 12/26/9</b> = EMA 12 − EMA 26, signal = EMA 9 of the MACD, histogram = MACD − signal.</li>
        <li><b>Bollinger 20/2</b> = SMA 20 ± 2 standard deviations. %B = position between the bands, width = band distance ÷ SMA.</li>
        <li><b>Stochastic 14/3</b>: %K = (price − lowest low) ÷ (highest high − lowest low) over 14 steps, using avg instant-sell as low and avg instant-buy as high; %D = SMA 3 of %K.</li>
        <li><b>On-balance volume</b>: volume added on up-steps and subtracted on down-steps, shown as a share of total volume.</li>
        <li>These describe past prices. The short text next to each value is a plain reading, not a buy or sell signal.</li>
      </ul>

      <H>Flip speed (buys vs sells)</H>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Instant-buys</b> (other players buying) fill your sell offers; <b>instant-sells</b> (other players selling) fill your buy offers. The split bar shows both for the last hour and 24 h.</li>
        <li>Buy fills in = your quantity ÷ (24 h instant-sells ÷ 24), in minutes; sell fills in uses instant-buys. Quantity = one full buy limit by default, or what your capital buys (limit left) when you switch it.</li>
        <li>This assumes you get the whole market flow, so it’s a best case for comparing items. Speed tiers use the sum of both sides: very fast ≤ 30 min, fast ≤ 2 h, medium ≤ 8 h, slow ≤ 24 h, otherwise very slow.</li>
        <li>Your hold = average time between buy and sale from your own trades (FIFO, weighted by quantity).</li>
        <li><b>Within reason</b> (on by default): the planned quantity is capped at a share of the slower side’s 24 h trades (default 25%) and at what your capital buys, and items are hidden as outliers when a side has fewer than 10 trades in 24 h, not even 1 item fits the cap, the last price is more than 30% away from its 24 h average, or the ROI is above 50% (usually a stale or one-off price).</li>
        <li><b>Returns</b>: on capital used = profit ÷ (quantity × buy price); on your capital = profit ÷ the capital you entered; per hour = return on capital used ÷ the hours both sides need to fill (at least 15 minutes).</li>
      </ul>

      <H>Flip Scanner: signals, presets, time away, slot planner</H>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Signals</b> use one price per day over the last 30 days (daily averages from the Wiki’s bulk data) plus the current price: 7-day sparkline, price now vs the 7- and 30-day median, RSI 14 on daily prices, the 7-day trend (more than ±0.5% per day counts as up or down), and on how many of the last 7 days the margin after tax was positive.</li>
        <li><b>Presets</b> start from the default filters and set only what differs, including their own sort. Your own presets are stored with your settings (and in backups).</li>
        <li><b>Time away</b>: the quantity is cut so both sides fill within the hours you’re away at your share of the flow (the “within reason” share): quantity ≤ hours × share ÷ (24 ÷ instant-sells per day + 24 ÷ instant-buys per day).</li>
        <li><b>Slot planner</b> walks down the current list (filters and sort) and takes one item per free GE slot, skipping items you hold or have offers on and outliers, with at most the chosen share of the budget in one item. Nothing is logged until you press the button; logged lines become buy offers with an expected sale price.</li>
        <li><b>Not interested</b> hides an item from the scanner, Top 10 and Big Trades until you show it again.</li>
      </ul>

      <H>Big Trades (lock-in mode)</H>
      <ul>
        <li>Items whose profit in one flip at a realistic quantity (within reason, at your whole capital) is at least the chosen minimum (default 5M).</li>
        <li><b>Verified</b> = all checks hold: the older price is at most 30 minutes old; both sides traded in the last hour; the margin is still there at the last hour’s average prices (at least half of it); the slower side traded at least twice your quantity (and 5) in 24 h; no outlier flag and plausible data; and the item actually swings (hourly variation over 24 h or daily variation over 30 days at least the chosen minimum, default 3%).</li>
        <li>Lock-in level from the best verified flip as a share of your capital: 5 ≥ 50%, 4 ≥ 25%, 3 ≥ 10%, 2 ≥ 3%, otherwise 1.</li>
        <li><b>Degen mode</b> (inside lock-in): a slot reel over the 40 biggest single flips on the market, one full buy limit × net margin, at any price and ignoring your capital and “within reason”. Items need a positive margin and at least one trade on each side today. The pick is weighted towards the top (rank 1 is most likely). Entertainment, not advice.</li>
      </ul>

      <H>Decanting</H>
      <ul>
        <li>Potions with dose variants (1)–(4) are grouped by name. Charged jewellery, waterskins and barbarian mixes are left out. Decanting at Bob Barter (GE) or Zahur (Prifddinas) is free.</li>
        <li>Buy = last instant-sell + offset of the input dose; sell = last instant-buy − offset of the output dose, minus GE tax per output potion.</li>
        <li>Profit per dose = net sell ÷ output dose − buy ÷ input dose. Output potions = ⌊input potions × input dose ÷ output dose⌋.</li>
        <li>Planned quantity = min(buy limit left, ⌊capital ÷ buy⌋, 25% of the output’s 24 h instant-buys converted to input potions), rounded down to a multiple that leaves no spare doses (e.g. 4 × (3) → 3 × (4)).</li>
      </ul>

      <H>Price alerts on items you hold</H>
      <ul>
        <li>Checked on every market refresh (each minute, also when the tab is in the background) for every trade with open items. “Sell now” = last instant-buy − offset.</li>
        <li><b>Expected sale price</b> (set when you log a buy, prefilled from the scanner, Top 10 or Decanting, editable in the trade): alert when sell now is ≥ x% above it (default 5%), when it reaches it, or when it is ≥ y% below it (default 5%).</li>
        <li>Without an expected price: ≥ x% above break-even, or ≥ y% below what you paid.</li>
        <li><b>Sudden move</b>: last instant-buy vs the average instant-buy of the last completed hour (24 h if missing), default ± 8%.</li>
        <li><b>Loss warning</b>: selling all open items now would be below break-even after tax. Starts 15 minutes after your latest buy, so thin margins don’t ping the moment you buy.</li>
        <li>Each alert shows in the bell menu and Flip History while the condition holds. It pings (toast, sound, optional desktop notification) once, then again at most once per cooldown (default 1 h).</li>
      </ul>

      <H>Trades, FIFO & portfolio</H>
      <ul>
        <li>Sales are matched to the oldest open buys using <b>FIFO</b>; a buy’s fees are spread across its items. Overselling is rejected.</li>
        <li>Cash = capital entries − buys + net sale proceeds. Open buy offers reserve cash but are only deducted once logged as a buy (no double counting).</li>
        <li>Est. market value of open items = quantity × (last instant-sell − tax). Without a market price they are valued at cost.</li>
